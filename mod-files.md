Hot shard identification Root Cause Analysis (RCA) lets you can identify a hot shard within an index. A hot shard is an outlier that consumes more resources than other shards and may lead to poor indexing and search performance. The hot shard identification RCA monitors the following metrics:

- CPU utilization
- Heap allocation rate

Shards may become hot because of the nature of your workload. When you use a `_routing` parameter or a custom document ID, a specific shard or several shards within the cluster receive frequent updates, consuming more CPU and heap resources than other shards.

Then this is added to check modified files.
